A `UILabel` subclass that adds a typewriting animation effect - as if a ðŸ‘» was typing it directly on your user's device!

`GhostTypewriter` was inspired by the following post [here](http://williamboles.me/ghost-typing-your-way-to-hollywood/).

## Installation

### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)

To integrate `GhostTypewriter` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'

pod 'GhostTypewriter'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

> CocoaPods 1.1.1+ is required to build `GhostTypewriter`.

### [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

Swift Package Manager is a dependency manager built into Xcode.

If you are using Xcode 11 or higher, go to `File -> Add Packages...` and enter package repository URL https://github.com/wibosco/GhostTypewriter into the search bar, then follow the instructions.

## Usage

![Animated Typing](typingAnimation.gif)

`TypewriterLabel` is a subclass of `UILabel` and where the animation (magic) happens. It works by taking advantage of the `attributedText` property on the label and changing the properties of the text content to gradually expose the text using an animation similar to what you get on a mechanical typewriter.

A `TypewriterLabel` instance when added as a subview will hide it's content.

#### Starting

Starting the animation will cause the content of the label to be reveal one character at a time.

> How quickly each character is revealed is controlled by setting the `typingTimeInterval` property.

There are two ways to start an animation: with and without a completion closure.

With a completion closure:

```swift
import GhostTypewriter

@IBAction func startAnimationButtonPressed(_ sender: Any) {
    titleLabel.startTypewritingAnimation {
        //Implement your completion closure body here...
    }
}
```

Without a completion closure:

```swift
import GhostTypewriter

@IBAction func startAnimationButtonPressed(_ sender: Any) {
    titleLabel.startTypewritingAnimation()
}
```

#### Stopping

Stopping an animation causes the characters that have been revealed to remain as is and no new characters being revealed.

```swift
import GhostTypewriter

@IBAction func stopAnimationButtonPressed(_ sender: Any) {
    titleLabel.stopTypewritingAnimation()
}
```

#### Resetting

Resetting an animation causes all characters to be hidden.

```swift
import GhostTypewriter

@IBAction func resetAnimationButtonPressed(_ sender: Any) {
    titleLabel.resetTypewritingAnimation()
}
```

It's important to note that resetting an `TypewriterLabel` instance does not cause the animation to restart instead you need to call `restartAnimationButtonPressed()`.

#### Restarting

Restarting an animation causes all characters to be hidden and for the animation to begin from the start again.

There are two ways to start an animation: with and without a completion closure.

Without a completion closure:

```swift
import GhostTypewriter

@IBAction func restartAnimationButtonPressed(_ sender: Any) {
    titleLabel.restartTypewritingAnimation()
}
```

With a completion closure:

```swift
import GhostTypewriter

@IBAction func restartAnimationButtonPressed(_ sender: Any) {
    titleLabel.restartTypewritingAnimation {
        //Implement your completion closure body here...
    }
}
```

#### Completing

Completing an animation causes all characters to instantly be revealed.

```swift
import GhostTypewriter

@IBAction func completeAnimationButtonPressed(_ sender: Any) {
    titleLabel.completeTypewritingAnimation()
}
```

#### Animation Options

##### Style

By default `TypewriterLabel` reveals the content as it animates however this can be changed to hiding the content by setting the `animationStyle` property to `.hide`:

```swift
import GhostTypewriter

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    titleLabel.animationStyle = .hide
}
```

> `animationStyle` is defaulted to `.reveal`

##### Direction

By default `TypewriterLabel` animates from character index `0` to `n-1` however this can be changed to go from charcter index `n-1` to `0` by setting the `animationDirection` to `.backward`:

```swift
import GhostTypewriter

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    titleLabel.animationDirection = .backward
}
```

> `animationDirection` is defaulted to `.forward`.

#### Adjusting Animation Timing

Each character of a `TypewriterLabel` instance is revealed at a pace set by the `typingTimeInterval` property.

`typingTimeInterval` defaults to `0.1` second.

```swift
import GhostTypewriter

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    titleLabel.typingTimeInterval = 0.3
}
```

It's important to note that setting/changing `typingTimeInterval` after an animation has been started, has no affect on the timing of that animation.

#### Storyboards

As `TypewriterLabel` is contained in a pod, when using it with storyboards you will need to set the `Module` field to `GhostTypewriter`.

## Migrating from v1 to v2

Version [`2.0.0`](https://github.com/wibosco/GhostTypewriter/releases/tag/2.0.0) of `GhostTypewriter` contains breaking changes.

* `cancelTypewritingAnimation()` now use `resetTypewritingAnimation()`.
* `cancelTypewritingAnimation(clearText: true)` now use `resetTypewritingAnimation()`.
* `cancelTypewritingAnimation(clearText: false)` now use `stopTypewritingAnimation()`.

## Example

> `GhostTypewriter` comes with an [example project](https://github.com/wibosco/GhostTypewriter/tree/master/Example) to provide more details than listed above.
